         The Analytical Arsenal: Stochastic Modeling & MLOps Sandbox

Project Status: Proof of Concept (PoC) for Behavioral Finance Modeling

This project demonstrates the full-stack capability in a quantitative analytical perspecitve:

Advanced Modeling: Implementation of stochastic and statistical models (Bayesian, Smoothing, Regression) in Python.

Full-Stack Deployment: Using the Taipy framework to deploy the models into an interactive, shareable web application.

MLOps Principles: Structure is designed for easy integration with MLOps tools (e.g., MLflow, Docker) for versioning and pipeline management.

         Core Problem & Solution

Problem: Standard time-series forecasting often assumes rational behavior. This project is a sandbox for analyzing simple, non-rational, or emergent patterns that deviate from pure statistical linearity (relevant to Behavioral Finance).

Solution: The application allows users to input sequential data points and instantly visualize predictions from multiple, often contradictory, statistical models simultaneously, forcing the user to evaluate uncertainty and model fit.
